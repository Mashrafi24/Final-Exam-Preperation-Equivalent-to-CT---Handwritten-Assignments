1. Abstraction
Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of 
the object to the user. It focuses on "what" the object does instead of "how" it does it.

2. Encapsulation
Definition: Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together 
as a single unit. It is primarily used for Data Hiding.


How it works:

Declare variables of a class as private.

Provide public getter and setter methods to modify and view the variable values.
