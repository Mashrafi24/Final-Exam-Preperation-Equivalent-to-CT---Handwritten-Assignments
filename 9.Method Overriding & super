Method Overriding & super

Same method name & signature

super.method() calls parent version

Cannot override final methods

Potential Issues & Rules (The "Contract" of Overriding)
When overriding a method, you must follow these strict rules to avoid compilation errors:

1.Access Modifiers:

You cannot reduce the visibility of the inherited method.
Example: If the parent method is public, the child method cannot be protected or private. (Public > Protected > Default > Private).

2.Final Methods:

If a method is declared as final in the superclass, it cannot be overridden.

3.Static Methods:

Static methods cannot be overridden. If you define a static method with the same signature in the subclass, it is called Method Hiding, not overriding.

4.Exception Handling:

The overriding method (child) cannot throw a new or broader Checked Exception than the overridden method (parent). However, it can throw any Unchecked (Runtime) Exception.
